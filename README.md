Intro to testing Ethereum Smart Contracts.

## What is all this stuff?

Don't let all the new folders and files in this example scare you away. For now, we only care about the contracts and test folder. These folders and files are generated by (Truffle)[truffleframework.com], which is a tool (or set of tools) that helps us write better smart contracts!

## What does this example teach?

In the previous example, we explored how to write a super simple Ethereum smart contract that stored a single integer. However,

Writing secure smart contracts is very hard (INSERT LINK TO HACKS), and one major part of this is making sure the contract is adequately tested. Here, we will be learning how to write tests for our smart contracts in JavaScript.

Some previous JavaScript expirence is helpful, but no worries if you no nothing. This is example is so simple you will be able to follow!

## How do I run the tests?

First, make sure you've installed (Truffle)[truffleframework.com]. If you get stuck during installation, checkout the Truffle installation FAQ here[INSERT LINK TO FAQ - or maybe add it here?].

Next, open up your command line terminal! If you've never used the command line before, you can check out a breif intro [here](https://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything). For now, you just need to be able to move around directories.

Use your CLT to navigate to this directory (when you type ls, you should see the build, contracts, and test folders). Then, write the command truffle test. You should see the tests run!

## Where are these tests running?

## My tests aren't running...

Your version of NodeJS is probably not up-to-date (or you don't have it installed at all). You can download node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
